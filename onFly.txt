Currently working on updating the client.go file to be organized better.  Its a mess.  I realized that the function for adding pokemon to a player is horribly set up, passing a 
string of player name instead of using UUID.  Fixing this now.

abstractions made so far
	joinAndWait()
	playerChoosePokemon()
	findOpponent()

by instantiating player and opponent separate from game, I am running into an issue where opponent and player may not update with game.  I think this is because the
reference becomes a locally addressed thing, so changing game doesn't mean it changes the same player or opponent I think it does?

I probably shoud just pull player and opponent off game ?  As in, the first player to join becomes player and the next to join becomes opponent.  Yea lets fkin do it.
I updated everything in the server side, so this should all be working properly now.  I just need to update the client side.

Host and Opponent naming should be agnostic to who is making the calls.  Host will always be whoever started the game and opponent is whoever connected to the game

This is actually really bad because of how client works.  I have to be explicit about who is doing what.  Maybe Host and Connected are better names.
